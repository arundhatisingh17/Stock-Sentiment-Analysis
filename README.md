# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis

## Project Outline:
1) start off by deriving the monthly aggregated social media sentiment.
2) Use semantic methods on the tweets to determine the major sentiment associated with each event and plot it out for better visual understanding.
3) Categorize the events into different domains - political, entertainment, etc.
   use the most suitable correlation method to analayze the strength of the correlation between - -- Google's stock prices and the monthly aggregated sentiments. (Should be grouped my month for 
   uniformity)
4) find out which event specifically had the strongest correlation with google's stock price.
5) use all this data to predict google's future stocks using time-series anlaysis.
